# Data Collection Pipeline Project

In this project, I implement an industrial-standard fata collection pipeline project that runs scalaby in the cloud.

In this project, I collect data from the book retailer, [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/)  website. The aim of the project would be to collect relevant data about books in the the bestsellers category using the Selenium Chrome Webdriver written in Python. The README.md file presentts the actions taken and the decisions made during this project.

The techologies used in this project include:
* Python (pandas, boto3, math, os, selenium, setuptools, sqlalchemy time, unicodedata, urllib, uuid)
* Cloud: AWS (RDS, S3, EC2)
* SQL (Postgresql)
* Prometheus
* Docker
* Grafana
* Version Control (Git, Github)

The steps taken in this code are described as follows:

# Milestone 1: Setting up the environment and the technologies used.
Here, the technologies used in the project were set up.

# Milestone 2: Decide the website to collect data from.
The book retailer, [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/) was chosen as the website to scrape data from. Relevant data about books in the the bestsellers category were intended for extraction. The online bookstore is one of the largest online retailers of books, toys, etc.

# Milestone 3: Prototype finding the individual page for entry
In this milestone, I create a basic SCraper class and added methods for initialising the initialising the Scraper, bypassing cookies, navigating to the best sellers page, and extracting the URLs of the webpages of each book listed in this category.

* Added a Scraper class with basic methods to initialise the chrome webdriver, navigate to the best sellers page, and scrape data using the Selenium methods: find_element and find_elements
* A method to accept cookies was added
* A method to obtain the links of the webpage of each book in the best seller category, and store these in a list.
* Execute the scraper class within an if __name__ == "__main__" block

# Milestone 4: Retrieve data from the details page
Here I will get all of the data for each record from each page in the list of URLs previously obtained. I also apply a unique ID generated using the uuid module to assign a unique ID for each book. I created a new directory using the os module and saved the extracted data in the folder as a json file. Using the src links extracted, the images were downloaded and stored in a directory. The already created methods were refactored and optimised several times.

* Create a function to retrieve text and image data from the books in the bestsellers category, and added it to the scraper class.
* The created method ensured that extracted data was stored in a dictionary that maps the name of each feature to a value.
* The raw data was stored locally in my machine
* A method that downloaded the images of each book using the image links was created.

# Milestone 5: Documentation and Testing
